Ping Chen is a Professor and Doctoral Supervisor at the Institute of Big Data, Fudan University, and a National-level Talent selected for the youth program. His group builds trustworthy intelligent vehicle and AI systems by combining systematic security architectures with resilient, data-driven defenses. He currently leads the Fudan **Security Laboratory**, a 30+ member team spanning undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers working closely with automotive OEMs, cloud providers, and AI platform partners.

## Research Focus

- **Large Models & AI Security** -- targeted fuzzing and capability probing for foundation models, automated defenses against RAG poisoning, and watermarking for heterogeneous multi-model deployments.
- **Intelligent Connected Vehicle Security** -- endogenous defense architectures for ADAS/T-Box, network resilience assessment, and integrated safety-security assurance for intelligent driving stacks.
- **System & Software Security** -- adaptive vulnerability discovery, cross-platform protocol analysis, and dynamic protections for cloud and virtualization runtimes.
- **Data & Privacy Protection** -- full lifecycle governance, high-precision device fingerprinting, and privacy-preserving risk analytics for large-scale financial and mobility systems.

## Experience Highlights

- **2021&nbsp;&ndash; Present &middot; Institute of Big Data, Fudan University** -- Professor, Doctoral Supervisor, National Talent Awardee. Established the Security Laboratory, delivering multi-agency projects and deep collaborations with SAIC, Geely, Huawei, Ant Group, and others.
- **2018&nbsp;&ndash; 2021 &middot; JD.com Silicon Valley R&D Center** -- Senior Security Architect & Head of Data/Risk Control Security. Led a 60+ person global team delivering data security, privacy compliance, watermarking, and anti-fraud platforms.
- **2014&nbsp;&ndash; 2018 &middot; Pennsylvania State University** -- Postdoctoral Scholar in software and system security, focusing on adaptive defense and malicious code detection.
