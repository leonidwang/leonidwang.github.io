Ping Chen is a Professor and Doctoral Supervisor at the Institute of Big Data, Fudan University. He leads the Endogenous Security Laboratory, a 30+ member team that partners with automotive OEMs, AI platform providers, and public agencies to deliver resilient intelligent vehicle and AI systems. His research spans intelligent connected vehicle security, AI robustness, system and software security, and privacy-aware risk analytics. Prof. Chen was selected for the national-level youth talent program and has coordinated 18 national and provincial projects with cumulative funding of roughly 20M RMB.

## Areas of Research

- **Large model security** -- heterogeneity driven safety reviews for diffusion models, RAG poisoning defense, watermarking, and capability boundary assessment for foundation models.
- **Intelligent connected vehicles** -- endogenous defense architectures for ADAS and T-Box units, network resilience assessment, and integrated functional safety plus cybersecurity assurance.
- **Endogenous cybersecurity** -- multi-agent offensive and defensive simulation, reinforcement-learning driven risk detection, adaptive protection against zero-day, APT, and large scale threats.
- **System and software security** -- data structure layout randomization, virtualization monitoring, and lightweight fuzzing strategies for complex software stacks.
