The Endogenous Security Laboratory maintains a comprehensive security toolkit for heterogeneous large-model deployments serving mobility, finance, and public service scenarios.

Highlights:

- Directed fuzzing pipelines that surface unsafe behaviors, capability gaps, and error-handling flaws across multimodal model families.
- Heterogeneity-driven watermarking and provenance controls used in the Fu Bao Think Tank LLM deployments listed in the 2024 Shanghai Large Model Product Catalog.
- RAG poisoning detection and collaborative defenses that monitor activation drift for early warning and automated mitigation.

The toolkit is jointly developed with municipal partners and enterprise ecosystems, and was named to the 2024 Shanghai Cybersecurity Innovation and Breakthrough Achievements Catalog (Rank 1).
