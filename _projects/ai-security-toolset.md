We build a comprehensive security toolset for heterogeneous large-model deployments across text, vision, and multimodal tasks.

Highlights:

- Directed fuzzing pipelines that surface unsafe behaviors and capability gaps in foundation models.
- Watermarking and provenance tracking tailored for heterogeneous model ensembles deployed in finance, urban computing, and mobility.
- Detection of RAG poisoning and prompt-based adversarial manipulation via model activation tracing.

The toolset is deployed with municipal partners and enterprises and was recognized in the 2024 Shanghai Cybersecurity Innovation Achievement Catalog.
