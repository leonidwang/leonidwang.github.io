This National Key R&D Program (PI: Ping Chen) builds an assurance framework that unifies functional safety and cybersecurity for intelligent driving platforms deployed by leading Chinese OEMs.

Key threads include:

- Endogenous security architecture design for ADAS and T-Box subsystems with coordinated safety-security requirements.
- Network resilience assessment, penetration testing, and automated remediation playbooks for vehicle-to-cloud infrastructure.
- Full-stack validation and zero-day preparedness spanning perception, decision, and actuation pipelines.

Deliverables include open reference implementations, tailored testbeds, and policy toolkits that partners such as SAIC, Geely, and Chery can rapidly integrate into production programs.
