This National Key R&D Program project develops an integrated assurance framework that unifies functional safety and cybersecurity for intelligent driving platforms.

Key threads include:

- Endogenous security architecture design for ADAS and T-Box subsystems.
- Network resilience assessment and autonomous remediation playbooks.
- Full-stack validation from perception to actuation, targeting 0-day and APT-grade threats.

The project produces open reference implementations and testing toolchains that are co-developed with automotive OEM partners for rapid adoption.
