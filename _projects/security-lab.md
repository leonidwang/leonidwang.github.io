The Security Laboratory at Fudan University brings together researchers across intelligent vehicles, AI systems, and cyberspace resilience. Since 2021 we have:

- Grown to a 30+ member team spanning undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral talent.
- Delivered 18 national and provincial projects with nearly 20M RMB in cumulative funding.
- Established joint research programs with SAIC, Geely, Huawei, Chery, Ant Group, and additional ecosystem partners.

Our roadmap focuses on creating verifiable security architectures for next-generation mobility, scalable AI trust, and privacy-preserving data intelligence.
