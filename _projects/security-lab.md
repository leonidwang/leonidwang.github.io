The Security Laboratory at Fudan University brings together researchers across intelligent vehicles, AI systems, and cyberspace resilience. Since 2021 we have:

- Grown to a 30+ member team spanning undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral talent.
- Delivered 18 national and provincial projects with nearly 20M RMB in cumulative funding.
- Established joint research and innovation centers with SAIC, Geely, Huawei, Ant Group, and municipal authorities.
- Earned city-level recognition through the Shanghai Nuclear Energy and Nuclear Power Collaborative Innovation Center and the Shanghai Intelligent Connected Vehicle Collaborative Innovation Center.

Our roadmap focuses on creating verifiable security architectures for next-generation mobility, scalable AI trust, and privacy-preserving data intelligence.
