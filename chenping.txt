Oct 2013 – Aug 2014: Storage Backup Security
Problem: Customers needed to backup OpenStack storage to Data Domain, but OpenStack couldn't provide encryption/decryption for Data Domain.
Solution:
Developed KMIP-based key management tool: create, destroy, and retrieve keys.
Encrypt/decrypt during Nova volume attach/detach.
Cinder volume encryption: When Cinder creates a volume, first create a key based on volume ID and store it in Keystone. When backing up volume to Data Domain (e.g., Cinder backup via iSCSI), retrieve key from Keystone and decrypt volume. Data Domain finally encrypts the volume.
Feb 2013 – Oct 2013: Data Domain Automated Log Analysis and Vulnerability Discovery
Problem: Research and design automated vulnerability analysis tool. Based on engineering experience, 70% of vulnerabilities recur and have signatures. If logs match a signature, quickly identify the vulnerability. If not, analyze logs, generate and add new vulnerability signatures.
Solution:
Designed and developed backend system, including log parser (JAVA), database (GreenPlum), search engine (JAVA) for signature matching.
Designed and developed recommendation engine for product upgrades.
